            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

I related vnto you the eÅ¿tate of our Leaguer as it then Å¿tood, with diuers particulars, concerning the Fort of <hi>Saint Martins,</hi> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iedging of <hi>Rochell</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Army. Since which time there are two Å¿euerall MeÅ¿Å¿engers arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>England,</hi> whoÅ¿e relation concerning the <hi>French</hi> affaires, both in the Maine, and in the Iland, is as followeth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King is now perÅ¿onally come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Towne of <hi>Rochell,</hi> being willing to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11850:3"/>the Siedge with his preÅ¿ence. Before his comming his brother the <hi>MonÅ¿ieur</hi> had vÅ¿ed all poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible meanes to annoy the Towne, being furniÅ¿hed with all Materialls and Engines fit for Å¿uch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>He lyes Å¿trongly intrenched, and hath a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and numerous Army, as being aboue thirty ThouÅ¿and thought by the LiÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>He plies the Towne with his Canon day and night, and hath burned Å¿ome houÅ¿es, with Wilde fire Balles, Granadoes, and other fiery MiÅ¿Å¿iues, which the BeÅ¿iedgers Å¿hoot into the Towne, for the moÅ¿t part, in the night time, out of their Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards and morter Peeces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rochellers</hi> notwithÅ¿tanding this, make a braue and reÅ¿olute reÅ¿iÅ¿tance, and haue made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿e couragious Sallies, in which they haue taken and Å¿laine many of the braueÅ¿t <hi>French Caualiers.</hi> And that they might make the BeÅ¿iedgers know, how little they doe eÅ¿teeme that great Army, they haue by way of open defiance vnto the <hi>French,</hi> hung vp the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Colours vpon the walles.</p>
            <p>They haue Å¿o plyed the the newe Fort (which the <hi>French</hi> King is building vpon the point before <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi>) with their Cannon, that they haue quite Å¿leighted and ruined the Fortifications of it, and haue Å¿laine Å¿undry perÅ¿ons of quallity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande in the <hi>French</hi> Kings Army.</p>
            <p>The <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Forces which beÅ¿iedge the Fort of Saint <hi>Martins,</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> vnder the conduct
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11850:3"/>of his IlluÅ¿trious Excellency, the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> haue deliuered vnto the World braue teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their valour and patience, being as well couraged in Å¿uffering, as actiue in doing, thinking no labour too difficult, nor danger to perrillous, where the honour of their Countrey, and their proper duty is engaged.</p>
            <p>They haue brought their approaches cloÅ¿e to the Enemies Counterskarfe, though not without Å¿weat, and bloud, there hauing beene made diuers braue SkirmsÅ¿hes by them, and diuers braue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts by vs.</p>
            <p>And as it is reported by a <hi>Duchman,</hi> who came lately to the Court, our men haue beaten the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies out of all their outworkes, Å¿o that both the Counterskarfes and the SkonÅ¿e without the Fort being loÅ¿t, there remaines nothing vnconquered, but the Cittadell it Å¿elfe.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e Out-workes, as this MeÅ¿Å¿enger relateth, are poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed by Colonell <hi>Gray,</hi> a man that knowes how to keepe his footing, as well as any Souldier in ChriÅ¿tendome.</p>
            <p>This report is likely to be true, as being deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon perill of his credit, yet another Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that came thence foure dayes before this <hi>Dutchman,</hi> and arriued at the Court, the Å¿ame night that the other did (hauing beene hindred in his iourney by meanes of a wracke) cannot, and will not aÅ¿Å¿ure as much.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Excellency</hi> before the arriuall of Sir <hi>William Beacher</hi> with new Supplies of Men, Munition, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11850:4"/>Victualls, Å¿uffered much, both in his owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and in the generalitie, and was faine to giue the common Soldiers out of his owne Å¿tore, to keepe them from mutining, and for continuing them in their duties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Soldiers doe much dutie, as wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by turnes euery Å¿econd or thirde night in the Trenches, which bringes Å¿ome of them into fluxes, feuers and other diÅ¿eaÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>BeÅ¿ides, they were Å¿o much diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed for want of Victualls before the comming of the laÅ¿t Å¿upplies, in Å¿o much that eight Men were put to fower Mens allowance.</p>
            <p>Yet this want was in part relieued by the Å¿urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing of nine <hi>French</hi> VeÅ¿Å¿ells or Shallops laden with Victualls, which intended (if they could) to relieue the Fort.</p>
            <p>BeÅ¿ides, there ariued happely a Shippe of <hi>BriÅ¿tow,</hi> which being laden with Victualls, did for a time relieue our Armie.</p>
            <p>To Å¿econd which good fortune, Sir <hi>William Beecher</hi> ariued happily and Å¿afely, with all requiÅ¿ite and neceÅ¿Å¿arie ProuiÅ¿ions, which did much refreÅ¿h our Men, and relieue our neceÅ¿Å¿ities.</p>
            <p>Neither were the beÅ¿iedged without their Å¿hare of wantes, but were troubled with them more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and preÅ¿singly, Å¿o that they Å¿ent to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie to parlie, and were reÅ¿olued to Å¿urrender vp the Fort.</p>
            <p>But as they were treating vpon Conditions, there hapned a Å¿torme that night, it being then a Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11850:4"/>by the benefit whereof, they did put into the Fort Å¿ome Å¿mall proportion of Victualls.</p>
            <p>But yet this was but a drop throwne into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of their wants, and like a Squibbe tyed vnto a Bulls taile, it encreaÅ¿ed their appetite and our anger.</p>
            <p>For although this deÅ¿perat aduenture furniÅ¿hed them with Å¿ome proportion for the preÅ¿ent: yet there penurie is growne as preÅ¿Å¿ing as before, and as the <hi>Dutchman</hi> reporteth, thoÅ¿e of the Fort are againe much diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed, Å¿o that want makes Å¿ome Å¿icke, and many Fugitiues.</p>
            <p>Through whoÅ¿e defect there are not aboue fiue hundred of the beÅ¿iedged left in the Fort, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are Å¿o weake, that they cannot Å¿tand vnder Pike or Musket.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> (MonÅ¿ieur <hi>Subeza</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) hath readie 7000. Foote, and 500. HorÅ¿e, well prouided and braue Soldiers in a readines, for the ayde of the ProteÅ¿tants.</p>
            <p>The Pope doth endeauor all he can to make this quarrell belong to the Emperour, the K. of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the HouÅ¿e of <hi>AuÅ¿tria,</hi> perÅ¿wading them it is for Religion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rochelers</hi> haue fully declared themÅ¿elues for the King of <hi>England,</hi> to which agreement, there are diuers Articles concluded on by his Excellence.</p>
            <p>His Excellence hath Å¿ent word to his MaieÅ¿tie, that if it will pleaÅ¿e him to Å¿end him Bread he will deÅ¿erue it, but if he will adde vnto it Å¿omething more he will drinke his Health.</p>

            <p>Our men haue mounted their Cannon Å¿o aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouÅ¿ly, that they command the Enemies Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and haue diÅ¿mounted them our of their Carriages, Å¿o that they haue not one Peece left to play vpon the Approaches, either from their Batteries, or CaÅ¿emates.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> knowing how much the honour of their Nation, and the Å¿afety of the neighbouring Prouinces on the firme Land depends vpon the keeping of the Fort, haue Å¿ought againe to releeue it with Å¿ixteene Boates, but being diÅ¿couered by our men, they were purÅ¿ued by our Long Boatse, Shallops, and thoÅ¿e flatt bottomd Boates, with which the <hi>Rochellers</hi> haue furniÅ¿hed vs, being VeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿els very Å¿eruiceable both for chaÅ¿e and fight.</p>
            <p>Wee Å¿uncke foure of theÅ¿e Barques, the reÅ¿t got into the Maine and by the benefit of their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legges eÅ¿caped our hands.</p>
            <p>The enemies neuer attempt to releeue the Fort but in a Å¿tormy night, and Spring-Tide, and then our Ships were of little vÅ¿e in reÅ¿pect of the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of the night.</p>
            <p>We haue no other meanes of hinderance, or preuention, but by the Boates and Shallops afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aid.</p>
            <p>There runnes away dayly many Souldiers out of the Fort vnto our Leaguer, notwithÅ¿tanding all the care and perÅ¿waÅ¿ions of the Gouernour.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e are not Å¿ent into the Maine, but kept in the IÅ¿land vnder Å¿afe cuÅ¿tody, becauÅ¿e they Å¿hall not carry any meÅ¿Å¿age, nor deliuer any particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceruing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11850:5"/>our Affaires.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e Fugitiues informe vs, by a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent of report, that the BeÅ¿iedged are compelled to Å¿uÅ¿taine nature with things vnnaturall, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uÅ¿uall to the Pallate: their greateÅ¿t daineties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but bread and water, and they are allowed that but in a Å¿mall proportion. So that they hold it for certaine, that vpon the arriuall of our next Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, the <hi>French</hi> will foorthwith Å¿urrender the Fort.</p>
            <p>I pray God they may come thither Å¿afely and opportunely, and then in humane reaÅ¿on, we haue no reaÅ¿on to doubt of good Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e; for if the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iedgers do not giue vp the Fort by that time vpon compoÅ¿ition, his <hi>Excellencie,</hi> by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, will aduenture to make a forcible entrie, He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right well in the cleareneÅ¿Å¿e of his iudgement, that the Defendants are Å¿o fewe and weake, that they cannot endure a generall AÅ¿Å¿ault.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, our men intrench themÅ¿elues to preuent the excurÅ¿ions &amp; Å¿allies of the Enemies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> doe earneÅ¿tly mediate for quarter at Sea, but his <hi>Excellence</hi> well knowing that no reliefe can come to the Fort but by water, will not grant them any quarter at all.</p>
            <p>But to deterre the Enemies from bringing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and to hinder their deÅ¿perate attempts, all thoÅ¿e which fall into our Sea-mens hands, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put to the Sword, hanged vp to the maine Yeard, or throwne ouerboard.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rochellers</hi> hauing no other Victualls but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11850:6"/>what is tranÅ¿ported vnto them from other places, and being doubtfull to be neceÅ¿Å¿itated themÅ¿elues, haue affoorded vs as yet no great reliefe, onely they haue exchanged Å¿ome meale for bread corne, and haue taken One ThouÅ¿and of our Å¿ickemen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Towne, and inÅ¿teed of them haue Å¿ent ouer to vs fiue Hundred of their owne Souldiers to fill vp our numbers, vntill the comming of the next Supplie.</p>
            <p>His Excelencie in the continuation of this Siedge hath taken more then ordinarie paines and care, Å¿paring his perÅ¿on from no labour nor perill, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the preÅ¿ent Å¿eruice: And although he hath hitherto been doubtfully Å¿upplyed out of <hi>England,</hi> by reaÅ¿on of the contrary winds, and the delayes which happen commonly in Å¿uch great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet he hath Å¿ubdued theÅ¿e difficulties with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible patience, and hath wonne an honorable reputation amongÅ¿t all the Souldiers of our Nation.</p>
            <p>For knowing that the vertue of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hed by nothing more then by the loue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence of their Commanders, he is wanting neither in the one or the other, but with his preÅ¿ence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts them in their night duties, and by viÅ¿iting and relieuing the Å¿icke and wounded, obliedgeth the hearts of his Soldiers vnto him.</p>
            <p>I Å¿peake not this out of any fawning or partiality, (trueth being neerer to me then the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham,</hi>) but only to make thoÅ¿e know (who out of priuate reÅ¿pects haue been maleuolent againÅ¿t
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11850:6"/>him) how much they haue wronged his merit and reputation.</p>
            <p>And although diuers men who are either affected to the <hi>French,</hi> or diÅ¿affected to his Excellencie, haue held the taking of the Fort of Saint <hi>Martines</hi> a thing more then difficult, as being altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿Å¿ible; and haue made the Siedge the Å¿ubiect of their ieÅ¿ts and table talke: Yet if in Å¿erene and more impartiall iudgements, we Å¿hall conÅ¿ider the cauÅ¿es for which this enterpriÅ¿e was vndertaken, and the meanes which doe facilitate and aÅ¿Å¿ure the taking of the Fort, we cannot chuÅ¿e but alow the deÅ¿igne (although diuers of theÅ¿e prepoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed Spirits haue cenÅ¿ured the contrarie) for honorabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ON teweÅ¿day, being the 23. of October, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of that Honorable Knight Sir <hi>Iohn Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes</hi> (who being Colonell Generall of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Infanterie in the IÅ¿le of <hi>Ree,</hi> was Å¿laine with a MuÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Å¿hotte from the Fort) was brought from <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> HouÅ¿e to <hi>WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter</hi> Abbey, where neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tombe of Sir <hi>Francis Veare</hi> (whoÅ¿e Pupill he had been in the art of Warre) it was interred, with great funerall pompe, and with Å¿uch Rites as were due to his deÅ¿erts.</p>
               <p>To Å¿olemnize his ObÅ¿equies, fiue Companies of of the Citie of <hi>London</hi> were drawne into Armes, being about twelue hundred in number, who mart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before the Corpes with their Cullours, Pikes and Muskets trailed.</p>
               <p>The Pike which he recouered with his Sword and Target from the <hi>Frenchman</hi> vpon our firÅ¿t landing (who charged him with it at the puÅ¿h, and razed the skinne with the point of it thorough his breeches) was carried aduanced before, with his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11850:7"/>owne EnÅ¿igne trayled, and his HorÅ¿e for Seruice clad in mourning blacke.</p>
               <p>Next to the HorÅ¿e, there went Å¿ixe and fiftie old Soldiers, with black CaÅ¿Å¿ockes, Swords and Staues, being as many in number as he was yeares old.</p>
               <p>His Scutcheon, Sword, Gauntlets and Spurres, were carried by the Heraulds. His Brother was Chiefe-mourner, being accompanied with twoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principall Mourners.</p>
               <p>Next vnto theÅ¿e, went the Earles of <hi>DorÅ¿et, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke, Carlile, BarkeÅ¿hire,</hi> and <hi>Molgraue;</hi> The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts <hi>GrandiÅ¿on Conway,</hi> and <hi>Wimbleton,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other Knightes and Gentlemen of qualitie.</p>
               <p>In the middeÅ¿t of the Abbey Church, a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Quite, there was a Å¿tately HerÅ¿e erected, which is yet Å¿tanding, couered ouer with blacke Veluet, where his Corpes was placed during the time of the Sermon, which was preached by Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> a learned and renerent Diuine.</p>
               <p>Vpon his HearÅ¿e his Scutchions were fixed, with this Motto, <hi>Nec inÅ¿iÅ¿to paruis.</hi> which in EngliÅ¿h is thus <hi>I doe not dwell vpon low things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sermon being ended, and Offerings being made, his Bodie was interred, and as it was put into the earth, the Muskatiers of thoÅ¿e fine Companies honoured his Interment with three vollies of Å¿hot, their Coullers diÅ¿plaied, and their Drumbes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, his owne EnÅ¿igne was broken and buried with him.</p>
